        but anyway, I've just been focusing on my hobbies lately lang naman and reflecting on our relationship. One thing I realize is that I was never consistent with you and I think that affected our relationship the most. I was able to stay up late during the early stages of our relationship and I was able to plan dates and talk to you more confidently. I'm sorry na things changed. I've always thought na since we're getting to that serious stage na we don't have to be romantic and fun all the time, but that's wrong. again, we're still young and spending a year or two, especially the last years of our hs, to enjoy life isn't really a bad thing and I never should've considered it as such.  <br><br>


    so uhm yes, I don't really know what i really want right now, but I'm trying to figure it out. I know na we talked about waiting for each other but u told me na you don't want that, soo it's up to you naman, briana. Im not going to hold you responsible for anything and you don't have any duties towards me naman.
